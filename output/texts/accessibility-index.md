# Accessibility index

## Accessibility
In order to analyze accesibility in a context of COVID-19 we've created and index based on the distance to different commodities and basic services. As we explored this concept during a pandemic we searched for the distance to pharmacies, supermarkets and hospital, which our team considered as vital spaces for groceries, access to medication and medical attention. To calculate this distances we used the urban morphology seen through the nodes and edges of the city roads which were downloaded using [OSMnx](https://osmnx.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). Each stablishment was analyzed indepently with specific distance parameters:
+ Pharmacies: hasta 300m se considera una cobertura adecuada y más de 1000m mala.
+ Supermarkets: hasta 300m se considera una cobertura adecuada y más de 1000m mala.
+ Hospitals: hasta 1000m se considera una cobertura adecuada y más de 5000m mala.
